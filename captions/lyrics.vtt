00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now and then I think of when we were together

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.500
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.000
Told myself that you were right for me

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.000
But felt so lonely in your company

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember


00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You can be addicted to a certain kind of sadness

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Like resignation to the end, always the end


00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So when we found that we could not make sense

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Well you said that we would still be friends

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over


00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But you didn't have to cut me off

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And I don't even need your love

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
No you didn't have to stoop so low

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I guess that I don't need that though

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But I don't wanna live that way

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Reading into every word you say

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
You said that you could let it go

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But you didn't have to cut me off

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And I don't even need your love

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
No you didn't have to stoop so low

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I guess that I don't need that though

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Somebody

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I used to know

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
  
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000                  
Somebody

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000  
I used to know

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000  

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000  
Somebody
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
    
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000                 
I used to know

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000     
That I used to know

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000   
I used to know

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Somebody
