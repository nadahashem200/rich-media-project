00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now and then I think of when we were together

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.500
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:47.000
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember


00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Like resignation to the end, always the end


00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over


00:01:35.000 --> 00:02:04.000
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

00:03:04.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
I used to know
Somebody
(Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
                    
Somebody
I used to know
Somebody
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
                    
I used to know
That I used to know
I used to know
Somebody
