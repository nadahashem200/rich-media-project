                <p>Now and then I think of when we were together
                    Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
                    Told myself that you were right for me
                    But felt so lonely in your company
                    But that was love and it's an ache I still remember</p>
                    
                <p>You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
                    Like resignation to the end, always the end
                    So when we found that we could not make sense
                    Well you said that we would still be friends
                    But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over</p>
                    
                <p>But you didn't have to cut me off
                    Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
                    And I don't even need your love
                    But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
                    No you didn't have to stoop so low
                    Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
                    I guess that I don't need that though
                    Now you're just somebody that I used to know
                    
                    Now you're just somebody that I used to know
                    Now you're just somebody that I used to know</p>
                    
                <p>[Kimbra:]
                    Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
                    But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
                    But I don't wanna live that way
                    Reading into every word you say
                    You said that you could let it go
                    And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know</p>
                    
                <p>[Gotye:]
                    But you didn't have to cut me off
                    Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
                    And I don't even need your love
                    But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
                    No you didn't have to stoop so low
                    Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
                    I guess that I don't need that though
                    Now you're just somebody that I used to know</p>
                    
                <p>Somebody
                    (I used to know)
                    Somebody
                    (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)

                    (I used to know)
                    Somebody
                    (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
                    
                    (I used to know)
